# A Little Background On Me

 - I love to code in python, html, java and especially love the tkinter library and started learning tcl recently. 
 - I love @tukaan and the work they are doing. I am super excited to use their gui api and am working to support them
 - My current big project is a personal IDE called JDE (I recently started a github page on it) as it should help me understand how they work and increase my knowledge on how programming languages work. The project was recently moved to it's own organization so technically my account has coded nothing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
 - Will possibly pursue coding/programming as a carrer or side job/hobby
