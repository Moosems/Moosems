# A Little Background On Me

 - I love to code in python, html, java and especially love the tukaan library. I love @tukaan and the work they are doing. I am super excited to use their gui api and am working to support them
 - My current big project is a personal IDE called DIP. Because I made it its own organization my account says I've coded nothing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
 - Contact me at moosems.j@gmail.com (I'll check it when I find time) or just open an issue on JDE-org/JDE
