# A Little Background On Me

 - I love to code in python, html, java and especially love the tkinter library and started learning tcl recently. 
 - I love @tukaan and the work they are doing. I am super excited to use their gui api and want to support them.
 - My current big project is a personal IDE called JDE (I recently started a github page on it) as it should help me understand how they work and increase my knowledge on how programming languages work
 - Will possibly pursue coding/programming as a carrer or side job/hobby
